BClayinghens

Welcome to our BClayinghens! The database comprises 61,133 visible light and thermal infrared images of laying hens, captured using smartphones, visible light cameras, and infrared thermal cameras. It is primarily designed to address a variety of visual tasks pertinent to egg-laying hens, including head object detection, target tracking, pose estimation, behavior recognition, individual identification, head temperature measurement, and health assessment. Each thermal infrared (TIR) image is paired with a corresponding visible light (RGB) image, with positional alignment achieved through coordinate correction. Additionally, the RGB images have been annotated with chicken head labels, yielding 63,693 head labels that are readily applicable for training deep learning models in chicken head object detection. These labels, when integrated with the corresponding TIR data, enable the analysis of chicken head temperature information. The BClayinghens dataset holds significant value for applications such as health monitoring, behavioral analysis, and counting in caged egg-laying hens.

We welcome feedback and corrections from all experts, and we will continue to update, refine, and share the relevant data in the future.

我们首次公开了笼养蛋鸡舍RGB和热红外图像数据集BClayinghens。该数据集包含61133张鸡只可见光图像和热红外图像，主要面向蛋鸡的鸡头目标检测、目标跟踪、姿态估计、行为识别、个体识别、鸡头温度检测、健康评估等多种视觉任务。所有热红外图像能够和可见光图像对应，并通过坐标校正实现了位置的对齐。另外，对可见光图像进行鸡头标注，获得了63693份鸡头标签，可直接用于深度学习鸡头目标检测模型训练，并能结合对应红外热成像数据可以分析鸡头温度信息。BClayinghens数据集对于可见光图像和对应红外热成像图像在笼养蛋鸡健康检测、行为分析和计数等应用具有重要意义。
欢迎各位老师批评指正，后续我们将会继续更新、完善和共享相关数据。
